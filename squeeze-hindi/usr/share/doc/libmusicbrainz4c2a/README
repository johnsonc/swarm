Giving credit where credit is due

If you write an application that uses the TRM interface (any functions that
start with trm_ ) you need to include the following legal quip somewhere in
your application -- preferrably the about box if your app has one:

   Copyright (c) 2000-2, Relatable LLC, All rights reserved.

Relatable has graciously given MusicBrainz a FREE license to use the TRM 
technology with MusicBrainz. Please give credit to Relatable by including the
above message into your applications.
