			GRAPHITE

Graphite is a smart font system consists of an engine, and optionally 
some common font and rendering system support code, which transforms a
Graphite enables font, unicode string and font formatting information 
(features, size, etc.) into a set of positioned glyphs.
In reality, Graphite does more than this, as it can handle cursor 
tracking, mouse interaction, string selection and other interaction tasks.

This is a meta-project the engine and each of the wrappers/backends are 
complete and independent projects in their own right and will build 
separately of each other's source (provdided any necessary dependencies are 
met of course). The wrappers project and subprojects depend upon pkgconfig 
(http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/) being installed on the developer's 
system to allow these projects to detect their dependencies to discover build 
and linking flags and decide what to build. If you do not have pkgconfig then 
you will only be able to build the engine "out of the box".
Building this project will build the engine plus as many wrappers as the host 
system can support (e.g. if you don't have freetype development headers 
installed it will skip building any wrappers which depend of freetype).

The *nix build system uses autoconf and automake including all the 
conventions of those tools. This includes extended support for debug, 
maintenance mode, etc. See the GNU autotools info pages for the appropriate 
tools for help.

If you have checked this source out of our Subversion repository or a similar 
version control system you will need to generate the autotools scripts and 
files (configure, Makefile.in etc) to do this run:

    autoreconf --install
        
Please see INSTALL for information on building

NOTE: 
If you modify any configure.in or Makefile.am file you will need rerun 
autoreconf like so:

    autoreconf
    
For those changes to affect the configure script and makefiles.
