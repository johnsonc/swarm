      Special japanese printer driver.&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;b&gt;This driver is a candidate for being marked obsolete with
      &quot;stcolor&quot; as recommended replacement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      This driver was not maintained any more for longer time and is
      &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=689595&quot;&gt;broken
      in current Ghostscript&lt;/a&gt;. Please use &quot;stcolor&quot; for these
      printers. They are not (yet) listed as supported by &quot;stcolor&quot;
      but this driver is probably the one which will most probably
      work. Please try similar models, especially the Epson Stylus
      800. If you have found a suitable driver and printer model,
      preferably one which we did not mark as obsolete, please tell us
      by reporting a bug on our &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://bugs.linux-foundation.org/&quot;&gt;bug tracking
      system&lt;/a&gt;. Choose &quot;OpenPrinting&quot; as product and
      &quot;foomatic-db&quot; as component.&lt;p&gt;
