    Professional, fast, photo- and duplex-capable 4-ink
    printer. Stackable, additional 250-sheet tray as option,
    &quot;TN&quot; model with ethernet connection available.&lt;p&gt;

    Best output quality reachable with the HPLIP
    driver, especially the 1200-dpi high resolution mode gives
    excellent photo quality.&lt;p&gt;

    For basic printing functionality use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;HPIJS driver &lt;/a&gt;. For advanced functionality such as printer status and maintenance features, use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hplip.sf.net/&quot;&gt;HPLIP driver&lt;/a&gt; (which includes HPIJS). &lt;p&gt;
    
    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer
    auto-detects the paper type and does appropriate dithering and
    colour adjustment internally, controlled by the hardware. So even
    when Ghostscript with the HPLIP driver only renders
    the image with 300 or 600 dpi, the 2400x1200 dpi are used for the
    internal dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will
    print in its highest quality, no paper type choice in the
    driver's options is needed. There is also a special high
    resolution mode where the image is rendered in 1200 dpi, without
    paper detection, intended for photo paper only.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer is equipped with a duplex unit, which is not
    supported by Gimp-Print, but by HP's HPLIP,
    &quot;cdj970&quot; or &quot;pcl3&quot;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: Color(CMY), Black&lt;p&gt;
