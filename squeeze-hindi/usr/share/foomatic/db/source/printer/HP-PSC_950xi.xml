    There is the standard model and also an &quot;xi&quot; model which
    stores more received faxes but does a lower maximum magnification
    for copying and a lower maximum amount of copies.&lt;p&gt;

    To get all functionality of this printer working under Linux,
    especially also the non-printing features, like scamnning, printer
    status, maintenance, and photo download from memory cards, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip&quot;&gt;HPLIP
    driver package from HP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

    In addition this device copies, faxes and prints photos directly
    from CompactFlash, SmartMedia, and Memory Stick, but these
    functions are currently only controllable by the front panel, not
    by the PC. To choose photos from your memory card, the machine
    makes an index sheet with thumbnails of all photos and you can
    mark which photos you want to print and how they should get
    printed with a pen on the sheet and then you scan the sheet to
    execute the printing job.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: 2 cartridges&lt;p&gt;
