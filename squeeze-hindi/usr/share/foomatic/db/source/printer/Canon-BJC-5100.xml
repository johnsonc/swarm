    <en>If someone believes this printer works -clearly document how to get it to work HERE.  It simply does not work since the protocol is proprietary and undisclosed.
&lt;br&gt;From all accounts, this printer does not use the same protocol as the BJC-4x00 line or the BJC-600.  No free driver is known to exist, and the protocol is not known to be documented.&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: black/color, color/photo, or black/black cart pairs&lt;p&gt;</en>
