    <en>The lq850 driver doesn't come with RedHat by default.
&lt;br&gt;The epson driver can work at 180x180, but looks bad at 180x360 and 360x360
&lt;br&gt;The printer can also emulate an IBM PS/2 according the the manuals, but I've never got this to work, even under windows.
&lt;br&gt;Draft mode has to be set using the switches on the front.
&lt;p&gt;For TeX, use the nechi driver. Its the same as the LQ, but at 360x360.&lt;p&gt;
