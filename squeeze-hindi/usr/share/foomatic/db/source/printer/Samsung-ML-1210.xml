    One of Samsung's line of host-based lasers.  They generally work
    well and cost little.

    Samsung sort of supports Linux use, with installable Linux/x86
    cups drivers often in the box, a penguin often on the box, etc.

    This particular model is the same printer as the Lexmark E210.
    The cartridges have a tab thingy to make them not interchangable,
    but it is easily adjusted.  The Lexmark cartridges apparently cost
    more.&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: toner&lt;p&gt;
