    <en>My first foray into Linux but I got
this printer to work just about!  I
used the printer setup from control
panel - ASCII prints fine, but there
are currently no KXP drivers/filters
so you have to use the HP Laserjet
one.  It doesn't work perfectly, the
bottom of the page was cut off but
I'm sure someone with a better
understanding of these things could
fix it easily enough.&lt;p&gt;
