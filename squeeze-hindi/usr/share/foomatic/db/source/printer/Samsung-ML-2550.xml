    Currently Samsung supports this printer with proprietary drivers
    which come with the printer on its driver CD or can be downloaded
    on the web sites of Samsung. Unfortunately, these drivers do not
    work necessarily with all Linux distributions. You will therefore
    probably get it more easily working by simply using it as a standard
    PostScript printer with the PPD file from its driver CD.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
