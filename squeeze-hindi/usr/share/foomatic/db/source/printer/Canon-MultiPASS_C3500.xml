    <en>Using Ghostscript 5.1, can get
reasonable 360x360 output using the
'bjc600' driver.  No support is
available for scanning or faxing
via SANE or any fax program I've
yet seen for Linux

Note that you do have to configure
the printer to run in 'DOS
emulation' mode in order to get it
to print properly through
Ghostscript.

From speaking with several different
Canon representatives, Canon is
taking the position that it &quot;never
claimed to support any operating
system other than Windows 95/98/NT
in [their] marketing literature.&quot;
and refuses to issue any information
to developers in order to have
suitable drivers developed for this
printer (even knowing that they'd
be having the development done at
zero cost to themselves).&lt;p&gt;
