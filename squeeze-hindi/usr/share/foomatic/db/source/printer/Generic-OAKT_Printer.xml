    OAKT printers understand a simple printer language that uses JBIG
    compression to send a bitmap (raster) image of the printed page to the
    printer.  This printer language was designed by Oak Technology (now Zoran)
    and is licensed by (at least) HP for the Color LaserJet 1500.  The printer
    language is highly efficient, but requires the host computer to render
    characters, halftones, etc.

    If you have a Windows driver for your printer and the &quot;About&quot; panel
    for the driver lists Copyright Oak Technology or Zoran, then you may have
    a printer that understands the OAKT language.  If you print to a file
    and the first four characters of the file are &quot;OAKT&quot;, then you have
    a printer that understands the OAKT language.

    There doesn't seem to be an official name for this language.  Oak
    Technology calls it simply &quot;Raster Driver&quot;.  That name is not specific
    enough, so we have named it &quot;OAKT&quot;, which are the first 4 characters
    found in the printer stream.&lt;p&gt;
