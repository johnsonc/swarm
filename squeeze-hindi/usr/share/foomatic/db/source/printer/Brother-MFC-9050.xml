    Antti Kaihola reports that the hl7x0 driver can print on this
    device at 600x600.&lt;p&gt;

    Scanning/faxing/etc is not known to work with any driver.
    &lt;p&gt;

    Brother publishes proprietary Linux drivers for CUPS and LPD for
    most of their laser printers and multi-function devices, including
    SANE drivers for the scanners. They can be downloaded free of
    charge on their &lt;a

    page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
