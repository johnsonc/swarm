    ZjStream printers understand a simple printer language that uses JBIG
    compression to send a bitmap (raster) image of the printed page to
    the printer.  This printer language was designed by Zenographics and
    licensed by most major printer manufacturers for at least some of
    their product line.  The printer language is highly efficient, but
    requires the host computer to render characters, halftones, etc.

    If you have a Windows driver for your printer and the &quot;About&quot; panel
    for the driver lists Copyright Zenographics, then you probably have a
    printer that understands the ZjStream language.

    The &quot;foo2zjs&quot; driver in combination with Ghostscript might
    possibly be made to work with these kinds of printers.&lt;p&gt;
