    Works best with Gimp-Print, here it also does its maximum resolution
    of 600 dpi.&lt;p&gt;

    Old user comments:&lt;p&gt;

    Choose the driver for the HP DesignJet 650C&lt;p&gt;

    Choose &quot;Normal color printing with color cartridge&quot;
    option in the printtools 'setup' option for the
    driver.&lt;p&gt;

    The driver only has a 300x300dpi resolution, though the plotter
    can do up to 600x600. Don't know if/how to make it work at a
    higher resolution, or if it doesn't actually do 600dpi, in
    spite of what the driver says.  &lt;p&gt;

    Also, the maximum paper size listed in the printtool is A3,
    although this plotter can do up to A1.&lt;p&gt;

    This plotter understands the HPGL, HPGL/2 and PJL language.&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: black ink cartridge -- approx. US$30&lt;p&gt;
