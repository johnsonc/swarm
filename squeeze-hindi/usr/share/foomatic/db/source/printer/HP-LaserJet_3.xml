    For basic printing functionality use the &lt;a 
    href=&quot;http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;HPIJS 
    driver &lt;/a&gt;. For advanced functionality such
    as printer status and maintenance features, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;
    HPLIP driver&lt;/a&gt; (which includes HPIJS). &lt;p&gt;
    
    Make sure you have at least 2MB RAM, otherwise it won't be
    able to print complex pages.&lt;p&gt;

    Widely available this workhorse just keeps going and going. It
    also uses about the cheapest toner available. Remanufactured toner
    is about $25, and Xerox sells new units for about $50. Cheaper to
    run than ANY inkjet. Keep your eyes open for used HP LJIII or
    IIID's they are a good buy.&lt;p&gt;

    Warning !!!&lt;p&gt;

    If you have only 1MB of printer RAM: This printer supports 300dpi
    only under text mode.  If you try to print graphic pages with this
    resolution, only 3/4 of the page will get printed and you'll
    get MEM OVERFLOW.  For a full page in graphics mode, you have to
    set the resolution to 150x150dpi...&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: Toner, ~$50&lt;p&gt;
