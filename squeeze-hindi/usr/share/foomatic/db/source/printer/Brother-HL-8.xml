    <en>Essentially a LaserJet II with 512K RAM.  I put in an extra
2MB module so I could print full-page 300dpi, otherwise you
can only do 150dpi. (Addition by tpo2:)
The printer doesn't really work without mem-extension here.
It does print out -some- pages, but not f.ex. pages with
(small) images in it, multiple pages on on sheet (mpage -2)
etc., even with 150dpi. (anybody with mem-extensions to give
away can contact me at tpo2@spin.ch)&lt;p&gt;

    Brother publishes proprietary Linux drivers for CUPS and LPD for
    most of their laser printers and multi-function devices, including
    SANE drivers for the scanners. They can be downloaded free of
    charge on their &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://solutions.brother.com/linux/en_us/&quot;&gt;Linux driver
    page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: toner (same as LaserJet II)&lt;p&gt;
