    <en>Reported by Thoralf Klein to work at 300 and 600 dpi with the ljet2p driver.  He says it's  very  slow.
Ghostscript-generated PCL often causes memory overruns at 600dpi.

Miltifunction device: fax, copier, scanner, etc.  Most of the multifunction features don't work.&lt;p&gt;

    Brother publishes proprietary Linux drivers for CUPS and LPD for
    most of their laser printers and multi-function devices, including
    SANE drivers for the scanners. They can be downloaded free of
    charge on their &lt;a

    page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
