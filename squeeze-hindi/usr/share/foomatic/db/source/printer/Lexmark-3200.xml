    Known not to work with Henryk's pbml7k driver, although he
    put hooks in for future support.&lt;br&gt;

    Luckily Daniel Gordini has written a new driver for it!  His
    driver needs testing; give it a shot and give Daniel some
    feedback. Use the 0.4.1 version (lxm3200). It supports all
    resolutions, all printing modes, head alignment, and more. If your
    distro has the old version compiled into Ghostscript and you do
    not like to recompile Ghostscript with the current one, the
    foomatic data for the old version is still available (lxm3200m,
    lxm3200c, and lxm3200p).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: 1 color &amp; 1 black or &quot;photo&quot; cartridge $40&lt;p&gt;
