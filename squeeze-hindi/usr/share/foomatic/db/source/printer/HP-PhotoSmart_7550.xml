    For basic printing functionality use the &lt;a href=&quot;
    http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;HPIJS driver &lt;/a&gt;. 
    For advanced functionality such as printer status, maintenance 
    features, and photo card unload use the &lt;a href=&quot;
    http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;HPLIP driver&lt;/a&gt; 
    (which includes HPIJS). &lt;p&gt;  

    HP's first 7-ink printer using three cartridges at once, a
    standard color (CMY), a black (K), and a photo cartridge (probably
    cmk). Because the printer's hardware does all dithering internally
    when HP's HPLIP driver is used, 7-ink printing is
    fully functional under free operating systems.&lt;p&gt;

    It has ports on the side for inserting SmartMedia, CompactFlash,
    IBM Microdrive, SD, or Sony Memory Stick digital &quot;film&quot; and
    has a color LCD panel which displays your photos (as a digital
    camera does) so that you can select pictures to print easily. This
    way one can use the device as a digital photo lab without
    PC.&lt;p&gt;

    It has a USB port on its front side to directly connect a digital
    camera (HP only).&lt;p&gt;

    Border-less (full bleed) printing on paper sizes up to
    Oufuku-Hagaki is supported with the HPLIP
    driver.&lt;p&gt;

    Best output quality reachable with the HPLIP driver
    (printer compatible to HP DeskJet 990C), especially the 1200-dpi
    high resolution mode gives excellent photo quality.&lt;p&gt;

    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer
    auto-detects the paper type and ink cartridge type and does
    appropriate dithering and colour adjustment internally, controlled
    by the hardware. So even when Ghostscript with the
    HPLIP driver only renders the image with 300 or 600
    dpi, the higher resolutions are used for the internal
    dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will print in
    photo quality, no paper type choice in the driver's options
    is needed. There is also a special high resolution mode where the
    image is rendered in 1200 dpi and interpolated to 4800x1200 dpi by
    the hardware, without paper detection, intended for photo paper
    only.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer supports an optional duplex unit (probably supported
    by the HPLIP, &quot;cdj970&quot;, and &quot;pcl3&quot;
    drivers).&lt;p&gt;

    When the black and/or the photo cartridge is not installed the
    printer does not stop working, it switches automatically to a 6-,
    4-, or even 3-ink process and goes on printing, but slower and in
    an appropriately lower quality.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: Refill: 1 black, 1 photo, 1 color cartridge&lt;p&gt;
