    Multi-function device: printer/scanner.&lt;p&gt;

    To get all functionality of this printer working under Linux,
    especially also the non-printing features, like scanning, printer
    status, maintenance, and photo download from memory cards, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip&quot;&gt;HPLIP
    driver package from HP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

    To get its maximum quality, use the HPLIP driver,
    since HPIJS 1.2 there is explicit support for this printer. 600
    dpi in colour is not supported by the hardware.&lt;p&gt;

    David Suffield, developer of HPIJS at HP, said about
    the HPIJS 1.1 driver:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;i&gt;HPLIP (set up as for the DeskJet 600 series)
    works for the Deskjet 850 series, much better than Gimp-Print, but
    color was not as good as with &quot;cdj850&quot;. Some people may
    prefer &quot;cdj850&quot; for color, others may prefer
    HPLIP for the speed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    Works also with the cdj850 driver (recommended by the
    &quot;hpoj&quot; team before there was HPIJS support) and also
    with the cdj550 (and probably other) color deskjet
    drivers.&lt;p&gt;

    The &quot;cdj850&quot; driver is included with Ghostscript as of
    Ghostscript version 6.0.&lt;p&gt;

    Printhead alignment supported by the front panel menues.&lt;p&gt;
