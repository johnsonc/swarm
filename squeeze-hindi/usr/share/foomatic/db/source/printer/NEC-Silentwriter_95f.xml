    This printer has 3 input ports: Centronics parallel, serial,
    Appletalk.&lt;p&gt;

    The MC68000 processor is supposed to recognize which input needs
    attending. I have only the parallel port hooked up.&lt;p&gt;

    The parallel port seemed to work fine when the BIOS settings for
    it were SPP instead of anything fancy, like EPP or ECP.&lt;p&gt;

    My setup was Linux 2.2.5 (a la SuSE 6.1).&lt;p&gt;

    My /etc/printcap lacked a trailing colon after the sh
    specification which caused lpd not to work until it was
    fixed.&lt;p&gt;

    It has both PostScript and PCL emulation modes, but I only use the
    PostScript mode.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: toner cartridge&lt;p&gt;
