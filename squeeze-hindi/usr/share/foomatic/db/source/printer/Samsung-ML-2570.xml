      Bug in Samsung-supplied PPD-file: OpenOffice.org 2.0 seems to have a problem with the ML-2570ps-ppd driver - it only prints in the top right-hand quarter of the page. OOo works fine with the generic PCL6 driver (pxlmono) and Postscript driver. No other applications known to have any problems with the ML-2570ps.ppd driver. This can be fixed by editing the ML-2570ps.ppd-file, which has a bug. Simply delete or edit the first line after &quot;*DefaultPaperDimension: A4&quot;. It is saying something like *PaperDimension A4/A4: &quot;842 1191&quot;, which is defining the paper size of A3. The correct entries for A4 are some lines below. So either delete this line or replace it by *PaperDimension A3/A3: &quot;842 1191&quot;
