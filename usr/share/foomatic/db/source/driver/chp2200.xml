    This driver is a GPL DeskJet 2200 driver provided by HP (!).  It's
    based on Uli and Matthew's &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj850&quot;&gt;cdj850&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj880&quot;&gt;cdj880&lt;/a&gt; drivers,
    with a new front-end to speak the different RGB-encoded PCL flavor
    used by these printers.&lt;p&gt;

    The original source package is not provided any more on HP's web
    sites. You can download it here from
    OpenPrinting. Installation instructions you find in the
    package.&lt;p&gt;

    The provided source is for gs 6.01; it probably works against
    anything at all recent. It is also contained in ESP Ghostscript
    7.07, 8.15, and later and GPL Ghostscript 8.60 and later. So all
    distributions using these Ghostscript versions and perhaps also
    others will ship this driver.&lt;p&gt;

    After getting a tip from the driver's author I (Till) succeeded to
    compile it for GNU Ghostscript 5.50. You must copy the function
    &quot;gdev_pcl_mode9compress&quot; from the gdevcd8.c file of the &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj880&quot;&gt;cdj880&lt;/a&gt; driver
    into the end of the gdevcd8.c of HP's &quot;chp2200&quot; driver. Then you
    follow the instructions in HP's source package and Ghostscript
    will compile.&lt;p&gt;

        <en>This driver published by HP under the GPL (!) sends RGB data to the
printer. This makes the printer transferring the data to CMYK by
itself and so it gives a colour quality as good as under Windows.</en>
