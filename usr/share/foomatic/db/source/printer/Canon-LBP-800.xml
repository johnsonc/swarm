    A real &quot;winprinter&quot; as the LBP-660, LBP-600, and
    LBP-460.&lt;p&gt;

    Works with the free driver &quot;lbp800&quot; which is based on
    reverse-engineering the undocumented proprietary protocol. The
    driver works only for a parallel port connection, not for
    USB.&lt;p&gt;

    Note that the proprietary parallel port data transfer protocol is
    non-standard and not very reliable. So use a cable as short as
    possible to use this printer. The parallel port must be set to
    bi-directional in the BIOS (should be already set on modern
    PCs).&lt;p&gt;

    If there is a PCL emulation, it is done by the Windows
    driver.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: EP22 cartridge / 2500 pages per cartridge.(A4letter @ 5%)&lt;p&gt;
