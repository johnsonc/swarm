    For basic printing functionality use the &lt;a 
    href=&quot;http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;HPIJS 
    driver &lt;/a&gt;. For advanced functionality such
    as printer status and maintenance features, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;
    HPLIP driver&lt;/a&gt; (which includes HPIJS). &lt;p&gt;

    This printer is not designed for usage with a PC, but for TV
    set-top boxes which provide internet access. Therefore it has a
    case of the shape of a VCR to easily integrate it in the home
    entertainment environment.&lt;p&gt;

    Nevertheless, this printer provides a standard USB and parallel port and
    understands PCL 3, which makes it also working as a normal PC printer,
    at least the developers of HP's &quot;hpjis&quot; driver claim 
    that. Windows drivers seem not to exist for this model (do we have the 
    first linprinter now?).&lt;p&gt;

600 dpi in colour is not supported by the hardware.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: mono cartridge; color cartridge; $21/26&lt;p&gt;
