    For basic printing functionality use the &lt;a 
    href=&quot;http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;HPIJS 
    driver &lt;/a&gt;. For advanced functionality such
    as printer status and maintenance features, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;
    HPLIP driver&lt;/a&gt; (which includes HPIJS). &lt;p&gt;
    
    Very inexpensive entry level model.&lt;p&gt;

    Does not understand PCL as most other DeskJets, it uses the
    so-called &quot;Lightweight Imaging Device Interface
    Language&quot; (LIDIL), these printers are supported by the
    HPLIP driver beginning from version 1.3. The driver
    supports resolutions only up to 600 dpi, head alignment settings
    stored in the printer are not made use of, so use a one-cartridge
    (CMY) printing mode in case of mis-alignments.&lt;p&gt;

    The printer's top cover has a frame to insert a picture of up
    to 8.5 x 15.5 inches (HP provides an appropriate paper) to
    customize it. The HPIJS driver allows printing on this special
    paper size, so that you can print your printer cover pictures also
    under free software.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: 1 colour (CMY) cartridge and 1 black (K) cartridge&lt;p&gt;
