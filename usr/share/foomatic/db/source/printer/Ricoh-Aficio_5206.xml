    <en>This printer is driven by a Fiery XJ80e print server. It's a network printer, and it supports most protocols (IP, AppleTalk, Novell, etc.). The machine has a local parallel port and built in 10Base-T. I can't get it to work through 10Base-T, and it's too big to move for trying the parallel port.</en>
