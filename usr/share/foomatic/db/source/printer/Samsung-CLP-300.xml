      The Samsung CLP-300 is USB-only and the Samsung CLP-300N has a
      network connector.&lt;p&gt;

      This is a cheap color laser printer with a proprietary
      language. Samsung provides a closed-source driver on their web
      site, the &quot;Unified Linux Driver&quot;, a driver package
      containing CUPS drivers and PPDs for all Samsung
      printers. Version 2.00.90 and newer supports also this
      printer. Output is raster-only, and due to glitches in the
      software, monochrome sources are output as color (visible flecks
      of cyan, magenta, and yellow). It is also not easy to install
      this driver in arbitrary distributions. See the user reports in
      the &lt;a
      href=&quot;show_printer.cgi?recnum=Samsung-CLP-510&quot;&gt;entry
      for the CLP-510&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

      As the first free software printer driver Rick Richardson's
      foo2qpdl supports this printer, but the driver still needs
      testing. So please try out this printer with both foo2qpdl and
      SpliX and report your results to the authors of the drivers and
      here on the site. SpliX seems to produce better color
      output.&lt;p&gt;
