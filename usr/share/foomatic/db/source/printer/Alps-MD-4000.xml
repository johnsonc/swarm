    This is a multi-function device with scanner, scanning is not
    supported but printing works perfectly.&lt;p&gt;

    J.C. Bradfield (jcb@dcs.ed.ac.uk) has written a fully functional
    driver which converts PPM files. He started hacking ghostscript, but
    abandoned it.&lt;p&gt;

    Also listed as supported at 300/600/1200x600 dpi in the
    &quot;md2k&quot; driver documentation.&lt;p&gt;
