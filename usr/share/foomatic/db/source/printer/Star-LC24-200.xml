    <en>Partial report from Leonid Mamtchenko.
&lt;br&gt;BW printing with Ghostscript works OK, although it's a bit blurry.
&lt;br&gt;He hasn't tried color printing yet.
&lt;br&gt;I don't know which gs device he's using.&lt;br&gt;

Report from Dominik Mierzejewski  :&lt;br&gt;
I've configured it using RedHat's Printtool and it seems
to work perfectly, although I haven't tried my colour
ribbon yet. Both Ghostscript and ascii printing is ok.
The driver is listed as 'Epson Dot Matrix, 24 pin', which is
probably 'epson' for GS.&lt;p&gt;
