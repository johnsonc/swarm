    This entry allows you to use any printer which understands Epson's
    ESP/P protocol with Foomatic, at least with the basic options. See
    your printer's manual to know whether your printer supports
    ESC/P. It can be necessary to set a DIP switch for that. This
    entry is not for modern Epson inkjets which understand ESC/P
    2.&lt;p&gt;

    Use it only for setting up your printer if your printer is not
    explicitly listed in the &lt;a
    href=&quot;printer_list.cgi&quot;&gt;Foomatic
    database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

    If you use this entry to set up your printer, note that not all
    features of your printer will be supported and that the options
    offered to you do not all necessarily apply to your
    printer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
