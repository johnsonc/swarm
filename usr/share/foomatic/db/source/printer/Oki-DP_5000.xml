    J.C. Bradfield (jcb@dcs.ed.ac.uk) has written a fully functional
    driver which converts PPM files (&quot;ppmtomd&quot;). He started
    hacking ghostscript, but abandoned it.&lt;p&gt;

    In reality this is the Alps MD-5000. In Europe it is sold by
    Okidata. I found this information in the README of Julian
    Bradfield's &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=ppmtocpva&quot;&gt;ppmtocpva&lt;/a&gt;
    driver. Perhaps the printer works also with this driver, but it
    works with Julian Bradfield's new &lt;a
    href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=ppmtomd&quot;&gt;ppmtomd&lt;/a&gt;
    driver.&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: several types of ribbon cartridges, black, cyan, magenta, yellow&lt;p&gt;
