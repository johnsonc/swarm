    Multi-function device: Printer, Scanner, Copier.&lt;p&gt;

    In contrary to the CX5400 this device has memory card slots, so
    that you can print photos directly from your camera's card, but
    you can also scan documents or photos onto a memory card, for
    example for usage with a PDA.&lt;p&gt;

    The printing engine is compatible to the one of the Epson Stylus
    C84, see that printer entry for more info. All but full-bleed
    works with Gimp-Print 4.2.6 or newer or 4.3.24 or newer.&lt;p&gt;

    Scanning should work as described for the Epson Stylus CX3200 and
    CX5200, best with kernel 2.4.21 or later. To make the &quot;epson&quot;
    backend of &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://www.sane-project.org/&quot;&gt;SANE&lt;/a&gt; recognizing
    this device, you have to add a line like&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;usb 0x4b8 0x805&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    to the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/sane.d/epson.conf&lt;/tt&gt; file where the
    two hexadecimal numbers are the vendor and product IDs of your
    scanner. You find the actual IDs in
    &lt;tt&gt;/proc/bus/usb/devices&lt;/tt&gt;. Search for an entry
    for an Epson device (the model name can be different to &quot;CX6400&quot;
    as often the Epson devices report their japanese market name) and
    in the line beginning with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; directly above
    the line with the manufacturer name you find the hexadecimal
    vendor and product IDs.&lt;p&gt;

    Copying should just work with the front panel of the
    device.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: 4 separately exchangeable ink cartridges&lt;p&gt;
