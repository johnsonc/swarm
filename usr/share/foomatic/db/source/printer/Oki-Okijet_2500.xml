    <en>Spoofs PCL for DOS apps under Windows, but other than that just won't work.

Using Redhat6.1 printtool, selecting the 
HP Deskjet 550C/560C/6xxC driver gave me a
picture perfect &quot;Red Hat Printtool PostScript Test Page.&quot;
It prints color and black in one pass.  Dithering and
color patches printed (some more accurately than
others).

Printer doesn't seem to accept text only in any way.

I'm making an educated guess at &quot;Mostly&quot; - 
I haven't done much with it yet.&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: cart, 4 ink tanks&lt;p&gt;</en>
