    <en>I have a KX-P2624 wide carriage 24 pin dot matrix printer that I just installed in Red Hat Linux 6.2.  I set my printer to emulate the Epson LQ 1050 and selected the following driver from the list:  Epson Dot Matrix 24 pin.
The setup worked for the three set up tests: ASCII, PostScript, and direct to port.  Haven't tried anything else yet.  This driver should work for most Panasonic 24 pin dot matrix printers.&lt;p&gt;
