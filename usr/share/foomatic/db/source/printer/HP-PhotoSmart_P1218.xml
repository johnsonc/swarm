    It has ports on the side for inserting SmartMedia and CompactFlash
    digital &quot;film&quot; and has an LCD panel that lets you select
    pictures from the &quot;film&quot; to print, so one can use the
    device as a digital photo lab without PC.&lt;p&gt;

    To get all functionality of this printer working under Linux,
    especially also the non-printing features, like scanning, printer
    status, maintenance, and photo download from memory cards, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip&quot;&gt;HPLIP
    driver package from HP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

    Best output quality reachable with the HPLIP
    driver, especially the 1200-dpi high resolution mode gives
    excellent photo quality.&lt;p&gt;

    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer
    auto-detects the paper type and does appropriate dithering and
    colour adjustment internally, controlled by the hardware. So even
    when Ghostscript with the HPLIP driver only renders
    the image with 300 or 600 dpi, the 2400x1200 dpi are used for the
    internal dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will
    print in its highest quality, no paper type choice in the
    driver's options is needed. There is also a special high
    resolution mode where the image is rendered in 1200 dpi, without
    paper detection, intended for photo paper only.&lt;p&gt;

    In addition to the PhotoSmart P1215 this printer has a duplex unit
    (supported by the HPLIP, &quot;cdj970&quot;, and
    &quot;pcl3&quot; drivers).&lt;p&gt;
