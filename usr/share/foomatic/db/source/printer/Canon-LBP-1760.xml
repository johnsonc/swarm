      Works fine, although I have only tried it up to 600x600dpi on
      A4.&lt;br&gt;

      Comes with 4MB of RAM; more memory is probably needed for
      1200dpi output.&lt;br&gt;

      I have no confirmed report as yet of 1200dpi working, but given
      enough memory it ought to.&lt;p&gt;

      I have tested an LBP-1000 which does 1200dpi with the ljet4,
      lj5gray, and the pxlmono drivers. With enough memory the
      LBP-1760 probably does it, too.&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: Toner Cartridge. Price about 99 Irish
      Pounds&lt;p&gt;
