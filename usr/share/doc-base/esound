Title: EsounD - The Enlightened Sound Daemon
Author: Eric 'Ricdude Mitchell
Abstract:  The Enlightened Sound Daemon can mix several audio streams 
 into one sound device. It will mix in pre-loaded samples, too. Want to 
 play a frightening sound whenever the user presses the "go" button? No 
 problem, just cache it, and play it back by sample id number.
