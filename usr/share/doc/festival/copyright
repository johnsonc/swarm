	Some further comments:

	Every effort has been made to ensure that Festival does not contain any
	violation of intellectual property rights through disclosure of trade
	secrets, copyright or patent violation. Considerable time and effort has
	been spent to ensure that this is the case. However, especially with
	patent problems, it is not always within our control to know what has
	or has not been restricted. If you do suspect that some part of Festival
	cannot be legally distributed please please inform us so that an
	alternative may be sought. Festival is only useful if it is truly free
	to distribute.

	As of 1.4.0 the core distribution (and speech tools) is free. Unlike
	previous versions which had a commercial restriction. You are free to
	incorporate Festival in commercial (and of course non-commercial
	systems), without any further communication or licence from us. However
	if you are seriously using Festival within a commercial application we
	would like to know, both so we know we are contributing and so we can
	keep you informed of future developments. Also if you require
	maintenance, support or wish us to provide consultancy feel free to
	contact us.

	The voices however aren't all free.  At present the US voices, kal and
	ked are free. Our British voices are free themselves but they use OALD
	which is restricted for non-commercial use.  Our Spanish voice is also
	so restricted.

	Note other modules that festival supports e.g MBROLA and OGI extensions,
	may have different licencing please take care when using the system to
	understand what you are actually using.

	A number of individual files in the system fall under a different
	copyright from the above.  All however are termed "free software" but
	most people.
