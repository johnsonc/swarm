 Rachana is a language campaign forum for the Original script of Malayalam in
 the digital computing. It started in 1999 under the leadership of
 R. Chitrajakumar (Malayalam Lexicon, Kerala University, Palayalm,
 Thiruvananthapuram). Hussain KH (KFRI, Kerala Forest Research Institute,
 Peechi, Thrissur) is the project coordinator who designed the font. Other
 Members are:  Gangadharan N (Malayalam Lexicon) who assisted Chitrajakumar in
 compiling the exhaustive character set of Malayalam; Dr. P Vijayakumaran Nair
 (KFRI) who assisted in programming the Rachana text editor which was used by
 many from 1999 to 2005 to typeset Books and journal articles in the old Lipi;
 Subash Kuriakose (KFRI) who gave advice to Hussain in the many aspects of
 Malayalam calligraphy. Later in 2004 Rajeev J Sebastian joined the Rachana
 team, whose mastery in Linux and untiring work is elevating the campaign to
 materialize its highest dream that to embed the original script in the OS
 enabling it in the whole field of digital applications. Dr. Mammen Chundamannil
 (KFRI) is an ardent supporter and well wisher of Rachana whose article 'For our
 language, our script' has spread the vision and objectives of Rachana to the
 whole world.
 .
 There seems to be some confusion regarding the license of Rachana. Praveen has
 confirmed that Rachana is indeed under GPL. Any queries regarding the exact
 status of Rachana license issue should be directed to Praveen
