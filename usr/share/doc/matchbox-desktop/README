Matchbox Desktop 2, a desktop system for handhelds using the GTK+ stack.

You'll want this in your ~/.gtkrc-2.0:

style "taku-window"
{
  font_name = "Sans 16"

  bg[NORMAL] = "#008000"
  fg[NORMAL] = "#FFFFFF"

  bg[ACTIVE] = "#00CC00"
  fg[ACTIVE] = "#FFFFFF"

  bg[PRELIGHT] = "#00A000"
  fg[PRELIGHT] = "#FFFFFF"
}
widget "TakuWindow" style "taku-window"
widget "TakuWindow.*" style "taku-window"
