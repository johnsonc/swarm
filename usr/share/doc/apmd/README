On laptop computers, the APM support provides access to battery status
information and may help you to conserve battery power, depending on your
laptop and the APM implementation.

Here's what apmd can do:

	- apmd(8): can log the battery status to syslog every now and take
	  action when the power status changes
	
	- apm(1): a command-line tool to print the current battery status
	  or suspend the computer;

	- xapm(1x): provides a battery meter for X;
	
	- libapm.a: a library for writing applications that interface with
	  the Linux APM subsystem.

Please read the manual pages for more information.

The license for library can be found in the apmlib.COPYING file.
The license for the remainder of this package can be found in the COPYING file.
