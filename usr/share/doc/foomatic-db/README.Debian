foomatic-db for Debian
----------------------

Note that the structure of the OpenPrinting (Foomatic) printer
configuration system in Debian (and upstream) has changed from the 2.0
series. There are 3 core packages:

* foomatic-db (this package): Contains the foomatic printer database.

* foomatic-db-engine: Contains the foomatic-configure script.

* foomatic-filters: Contains the filter scripts for various backend
  printing systems.
